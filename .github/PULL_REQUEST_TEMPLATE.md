Hotfixes should be submitted to `master` branch and the changes are published
automatically whenever a pull request is merged.  As part of the PR process,
you will be asked to provide the information necessary to make that happen.

Pull requests on new features should be submitted to `dev` branch and will be
regularly merged into `master` after evaluations over an extended period of
time.
