# Welcome to GitSavvy

GitSavvy provides integration between Sublime Text 3 and Git.

GitSavvy does not add any menus. Instead the way it works is by typing commands into the Command Palette (see Too Tools > Command Palette).

If you're a new user and you find yourself asking, _"Can GitSavvy do X?"_, there are two places to look.  First, open your command palette and type `GitSavvy: help`.  This will take you to the offline wiki-style documentation.

You can also check for configurability options by opening `Preferences > Package Settings > GitSavvy > Settings - Default` in the ST3 menu.  Any optional or configurable behavior will be documented here, along with the default values.

If you need help along the way, there's usually someone around in our Gitter channel:
https://gitter.im/divmain/GitSavvy

Finally, if at any time you encounter a bug, or if you wish that GitSavvy included some missing functionality, please open an issue:
