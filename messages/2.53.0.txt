GitSavvy 2.53.0
===============

(Initial) support for worktrees is finally here.   🤞


Worktrees are generally displayed in the branches view.
There you can create (`w`), check out (`c`), or `d`elete them.

The main menu in the Repo History (`enter`) also has an entry to
create new worktrees.


--

There is a new setting `users_home` which is now used as a *fallback*
when creating worktrees or cloning repos.  Maybe make sure that this
is a sane writeable path on your system.  But this is just a fallback.


--

When in the graph, you can grab tags or branches using ctrl+c, and
re-create them at a different commit with ctrl+v.  A handy shortcut.


--

We're a bit sparse now when configuring and fetching forks.  E.g. we
might by default ignore their tags or their HEAD (default branch),
e.g. when fetching PR's.



Already, almost 🎄
