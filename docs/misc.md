# Miscellaneous features

## `git: init`

This command will initialize a new repository, or re-initialize a pre-existing one.  As such, use it carefully - if GitSavvy detects that Git is already initialized, you will be prompted to confirm.

When run, you will asked to confirm the root directory of the new Git repository.  GitSavvy will attempt to auto-detect this for you.

This command will also be suggested to you should you attempt to run a GitSavvy command on a file that is not within a valid Git repository.
