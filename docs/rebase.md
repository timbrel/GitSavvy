# Rebase dashboard

## Overview

GitSavvy's rebase dashboard lets you:

- view a list of commits between your HEAD and the inferred start of the branch;
- re-order commits in your branch;
- squash commits in your branch;
- edit commit messages for commits in your branch; and
- rebase on top of any local or remote ref.

Re-ordering and squashing take a single key-press, with no further interaction required.  Editing is similar, with the additional step of modifying the commit message and submitting.

Rebasing is a guided process.  If merge conflicts occur in the middle of the rebase, specifics will be displayed and the conflicting file(s) will be shown below the commit in question.  At that time, you can resolve the changes and continue with the rebase.

Commits are shown in order of application, where the base commit (or inferred root of your branch) is displayed first, and the last commit made is displayed last.

Manipulating commits is not allowed when the current branch is not connected to the base-ref. You need need to select another base-ref or rebase first.


## Actions

### Manipulating commits

#### Squash commit with above (`q`)

The selected commit will be squashed with the commit above it.  The two commit messages will be combined into the one above.

**Note:** This command cannot be performed while a rebase is ongoing.

#### Squash commit with a previous commit (`Q`)

A list of commits will be displayed, the commit under cursor will be squashed with the selected commit.  The two commit messages will be combined into one.

**Note:** This command cannot be performed while a rebase is ongoing.

#### Squash all commits (`S`)

All commits listed in the view, from the base to HEAD, will be squashed into a single commit.  All commit messages will be combined into the single commit that results from this operation.

**Note:** This command cannot be performed while a rebase is ongoing.

#### Edit commit message (`e`)

When this command is run, a new view will be displayed containing the commit message from the selected commit.  Once you've completed any desired edits, submit the changes using the instructions in the view, and the commit's message will be updated.

**Note:** This command cannot be performed while a rebase is ongoing.

#### Move commit down (`d`)

This will move the commit from its current location in the commit chain to be positioned *immediately* after the next commit.

**Note:** This command cannot be performed while a rebase is ongoing.

#### Move commit down (`D`)

A list of commits will be displayed, the commit under cursor will be moved from its current location in the commit chain to after the selected commit.

**Note:** This command cannot be performed while a rebase is ongoing.

#### Move commit up (`u`)

This will move the commit from its current location to be positioned *immediately* before the previous commit.  This command may fail if a merge conflict would arise from the operation.

**Note:** This command cannot be performed while a rebase is ongoing.

#### Move commit up (`U`)

A list of commits will be displayed, the commit under cursor will be moved from its current location in the commit chain to before the selected commit.

**Note:** This command cannot be performed while a rebase is ongoing.

#### Show commit (`w`)

This will display the selected commit data and meta-data in a new window, including author, date, diff, message, etc.


### Rebasing

#### Initial base tip detection

When opening the rebase dashboard, GitSavvy will attempt to automatically deteremine the base-ref to use. First it will lookup the root commit of the current branch, i.e. the HEAD when you typed `git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME`.

Failing to find the nearest base ref branch, GitSavvy will use the tracked branch if configured, else fallback to `master`.

The resulting branch is then used as the starting point for the displayed information.

#### Define base ref for the dashboard (`f`)

If you want to compare the current branch against something other than the initially detected branch, using this command will allow you to make that selection. You can override the default, per-project, by adding a `rebase_default_base_ref` to your `.sublime-project` file:

```json
{
    "folders": [
        {
           "path": "XYZ"
        }
    ],
    "settings": {
        "rebase_default_base_ref": "develop"
    }
}
```

#### Rebase branch on top of other branch (`r`)

When running this command, you will be prompted for the branch on top of which you'd like to rebase.  Once selected, a rebase operation will be initiated (`git rebase BASE_REF`).

If any merge conflicts occur while rebasing, the state of the operation will be reflected in the dashboard, with successful rebased commits showing a check mark, and the commit with the current merge conflict showing an X as well as a list of files with conflicts.

#### Toggle perserve merges mode (`m`)

In default, merges will be lost when rebasing. If perserve merges mode is on, commits within a merge are displayed as a single item to avoid commits accidentally moving in or moving out of the merge. If any conflicts occur while rebasing a merge commit, the commits within the merge will be shown and the commit at conflict will be marked.

#### Continue rebase (`c`)

If a merge conflict occurs, you should resolve the conflict with one of the available options (listed below).  Once that is done and all conflicts are addressed, no conflicting files should be displayed in the dashboard.  At that time, run this command to continue the rebase operation.

#### Skip conflicting commit (`k`)

If a merge conflict occurs, sometimes it is acceptable to skip the offending commit.  Use this command to make that choice.

#### Abort rebase (`A`)

If you are unable to address merge conflicts that arise, or wish to abort the incomplete rebase for any reason, use this command to revert to the state before you began.

### Managing conflicts

**Note:** These key-bindings are only available mid-rebase when conflicts occur.

#### Open file (`o`)

Selecting a conflicting file and running this command will open the selected file in a new view, ready for you to make modifications.

#### Stage file in current state (`s`)

If you've addressed merge conflicts manually or with an external merge tool, select the file in question and run this command to add the file to the index.  This command (or one of the "use version X" commands) must be run before continuing a rebase when conflicts occur.

#### Use version from your commit (`y`)

When a conflict occurs, selecting the file in question and running this command will indicate to Git that you'd like to use the version of the file that was originally in your branch.

This is equivalent to `git checkout --theirs -- FILE_PATH`.  This is correct because, during rebase, "ours" refers to the branch you're rebasing on top of.

#### Use version from new base (`b`)

When a conflict occurs, selecting the file in question and running this command will indicate to Git that you'd like to use the version of the file that is found in the new base commit.

This is equivalent to `git checkout --ours -- FILE_PATH`.  This is correct because, during rebase, "ours" refers to the branch you're rebasing on top of.

#### Resolve conflict with external merge tool (`M`)

When a conflict occurs, selecting the file in question and running this command will launch the external merge tool to resolve the conflict.  Once complete, if the merge tool does not automatically do so, press `g` to add the resolved version to the index.

## `git: rebase from terminal`

As many users does set there EDITOR to `subl -nw`. Then when you run  `git rebase -i master` it will open a new window of sublime and have syntax highlighting. As well as keyboard shortcut for change lines to different command. `control+shift+s` for squash, `control+shift+r` for reword and etc.
