        This issue has been tagged with the `not-enough-information` label.  In order for us to help you, please respond with the following information:

        - A description of the problem, including any relevant error output that you find in the Sublime console.
        - Steps to reproduce, if possible.
        - The path of the `git` variable that GitSavvy detects.
        - The path that `GitSavvy` is configured to use (optional).
        - The operating system that you are using.

        To save time, you can determine much of this by opening the Sublime console (press ``Ctrl-` ``) and pasting the following into the provided box:

        ```python
        import shutil, sys, sublime; print("which git:", shutil.which("git")); print("os:", sys.platform); print("sublime version:", sublime.version()); print("GitSavvy git:", sublime.load_settings("GitSavvy.sublime-settings").get("git_path"))
        ```

        Additionally, if you are reporting a bug that only occurs in specific circumstances, please also do the following:

        - Open the command palette (either `Cmd-Shift-P` or `Ctrl-Shift-P`) and enter `GitSavvy: enable logging`
        - Go ahead and reproduce the incorrect behavior.
        - Open the command palette again and enter `GitSavvy: disable logging`.
        - Open the command palette a final time and enter `GitSavvy: view recorded log`.
        - Copy the log output and included it in this ticket (inside triple-backticks - ```` ``` ````).

        If we receive no response to this issue within 2 weeks, the issue will be closed.  If that happens, feel free to re-open with the requested information.  Thank you!
